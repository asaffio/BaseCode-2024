# BaseCode-2024
Lab exercises for the AI &amp; Robotics course, International MS on AI, UniBo.
- This repository contains the base Python code for each Lab.
- The base code provides the intended structure, flow and organization of each Lab, but many of the functions are "dummy".
- To perform each Lab, students are expected to copy this code in their own working directory, add the needed ROS parts to communicate with the simulated robot, and complete the "dummy" functions according to the respective Lab instructions.
